- 👋 Hello, I am @uesseu
- 👀 I’m interested in Brain Machine Interface.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about new Brain analyzing algorithms (SNN, HHT, fractal)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scientists about EEG/MEG or campany about BMI.
- 📫 email: sheepwing@kyudai.jp

I developped extreeeeemly high speed real-time EEG/MEG analyzer.🚗===   
Extreamly high speed in real-time analysis means "Extreamly detailed analysis".🔍  
Unfortunately, the program is still private.(´・ω・｀)  
However, I want to make part of my software OSS.( ･`ω･´)
